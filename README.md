After typing out necessary HTML for basic formatting, used AJAX calls using API keys to find necessary data for the user depending on US City input into field. When data comes back, decided to build the data and the html and appending into the container HTML. Used a forEach loops in the second half of script to build an array of 5 weather data objects to create 5-day future forecast. 

For the search history, ul was made so that each time a new city was input, we create a new li with the data and city name and append to the said ul.
